addedInAGroup:
  "Hey, lads.\n\nA warning, please do not put me as an administrator, as well as unnecessary, every time a bot is
placed as administrator in a group he has access to messages sent by his members; that is, I would end seeing things 
that you would not want me to see. Remember that to use me just call me with:\n
```
${botName} spoiler message here
```\n\n
So I will end up seeing only what I call to see and I will hide the spoiler that you want to send to avoid other people 
see you unnecessarily :)"
